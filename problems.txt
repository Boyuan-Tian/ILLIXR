- Not catching ctrl+C. This causes a crash before the destructors are run.
- Calling `stop()` twice. This causes a crash before the destructors run.
- Not calling delete on runtime. This prevents the destructors from being called.
- `~threadloop` joins the thread, but derived gets destroyed first. This causes a crash while the destructors are being run.
- Stopping switchboard after destroying components. This prevents the destructors from being run.
- Destroying shared libraries before destroying components (destructor ordering). This causes a crash while the destructors are being run.
- Nonvirtual destructor in polymorphic class (pose_prediction, swichboard, record). This causes undefined behavior and prevents the destructors from being run.
- (feature) Rewrote with std::vector<std::any> instead of reflection. This allows:
  - Removing Python-generated code.
  - Removing the pointer-arithmetic and void-casts.
  - Virtual destructor in record.
    - (feature) Assert usage taint in destructors.
- Not looping in sqlite_thread. This prevented data from being logged.
- `audio_pipeline/Makefile` was incorrectly not rebuilding when `common/` changes. This causes crashes for unrelated reasons.
- Log when a topic has unprocessed data. This helps us identify when a callback is not running at max frequency, rather than not being logged properly.
