# ILLIXR

ILLIXR (pronounced like elixir) is an open-source Extended Reality (XR) benchmark suite. It contains
several core state-of-the-art components of a generic XR pipeline, components that are required in
most, if not all, XR applications. Mosst of the functionality is implemented as plugins in our
runtime.

# Get In Touch

Whether you are a computer architect, a systems person, an XR application developer, or just anyone interested in XR, we would love to hear your feedback on ILLIXR! ILLIXR is a living benchmark suite and we would like to both refine existing components and add new ones. We believe ILLIXR has the opportunity to drive future computer architecture and systems research for XR, and can benefit from contributions from other researchers and organizations. If you would like to be a part of this effort, please contact us at _illixr at cs dot illinois dot edu_
