	 * call get(1) twice to name those. The subcomponent IDs could be reused (non-unique), but tuple
	 * (component ID, subcomponent ID) will still be unique. You can also just use the global
	 * namespace for everything, if you do not care about generating small integers for the IDs.

	 * @brief Coalesces logs of the same type to be written back as a single-transaction.

	 * In some backend-implementations, logging many logs of the same type is more efficient than
	 * logging them individually; However, the client often wants to produce one log-record at a
	 * time. This class resolves this mismatch by buffering logs from the client. Every time a new
	 * log is added, an internal decision process determines whether or not to flush the buffer, or
	 * keep accumulating and wait unitl later.
	 *
	 * Currently this internal decision process is "is the oldest log in the buffer more than 1
	 * second old?". I chose this because this frequency should have very little overhead, even if
	 * every component is also coalescing at 1 per second.
	 *
	 * At destructor time, any remaining logs are flushed.
	 *
	 * Use like:
	 *
	 * \code{.cpp}
	 * log_coalescer(logger);
	 * lc.log(std::make_unique<const start_skip_iteration_record>(id, it, skip_it));
